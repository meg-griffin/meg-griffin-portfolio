          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            I'm a senior UX engineer from Connecticut with over 14 years of
            experience within an agency setting. I've created innovative,
            engaging, user-focused solutions for a wide variety of products
            including educational platforms, onboarding experiences, and
            corporate training programs. I care deeply about bridging the gap
            between design and development by creating and maintaining
            component-based design systems with clear guidelines and
            documentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy gardening, growing hot peppers, collecting
            VHS tapes, making zines, italo disco, and detrashing local parks
            with my family.
          </p>

          <p>Bye! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
