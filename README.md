### About Me

#### [meggriff.in](https://meggriff.in)

I'm a senior UX engineer from Connecticut with over 14 years of
experience within an agency setting. I've created innovative,
engaging, user-focused solutions for a wide variety of products
including educational platforms, onboarding experiences, and
corporate training programs. I care deeply about bridging the gap
between design and development by creating and maintaining
component-based design systems with clear guidelines and
documentation.
